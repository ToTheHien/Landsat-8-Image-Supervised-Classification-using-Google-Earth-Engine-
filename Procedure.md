First, we sample the region of interesst by points.

The result contain many false classifications. Especially, the mix region between urban and agriculture. There are a few option to improve this classification:

- Change the training sample size: use polygons instead of points for more training pixels.
- Change the sampling strategy: some land cover class cover much more area than others. We could experiment with a stratified sampling approach instead.
- Change the algorithm: try different algorithm to approach the classification.

Thus, in the next step we combine points and polygon sampling.

This result still contain the mixing-false region of urban and agriculture, also on the island areas. Let try to use only polygon sampling.

Now the classification get more accurate. Next we use different algorithm to decide which one is suitable for our work.

Those result are list in evaluated order from top to bottom. From the real image we clarify that the *gmoMaxEnt()* algorithm is the most pertinent algorithm for our classification
